# latexcv - LaTex CV and Resume Collection

A collection of simple and easy to use, yet powerful LaTex templates for CV and resume. All of them are self designed and self implemented and not copied from template collections.

If there are any problems, please create an issue. I will fix it asap. **Contributors are very welcome**.
